About

Simply put, this patch shrinks down parts of the webOS UI to make things more space-efficient. I've always thought the Pre3 was wasting too much screen real estate with seemingly "over-sized" graphics. There are a number of benefits to this including:

- Launcher: You'll now be able to see 20 icons on the screen at the same time. There are four icons per row and 5.5 per column
- Dashboard: Everything about the notification area is a little smaller. I tried to keep the text as close to regular size as possible, but had to make it 2px smaller so it would fit.
- Lockscreen: The clock is a little smaller. Everything else is unchanged.
- Quick Launcher: You can now add an additional icon for a total of six.
